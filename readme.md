Grade Calculator
    Course grade is out of 1000 points + 30 extra credit points
    10 labs (50 pts)
    5 assignments (500 pts)
    1 term project (350 pts)
    1 final (100 pts)
    1 review project (MEC) (30 pts)


Pseudocode:
    Grade class
    public:
        int total_sum;
        char final;
        std::vector<int> grades;
private:
    Function to ask for user input
        split up each grade category (lab/hw/project/etc) into its own function
        Everytime we get input, push it back to the vector
    Function to calculate grade
    Function to print grade


Ask user for input for all 18 grades
Ask for labs first - each out of 5 points
    If your input is less than 0 or greater than 5, re-ask for input
Ask for assignments next - out of 100/each
    If your input is less than 0 or greater than 100, ask again
Ask for term project (350)
    If conditions - ask again
Ask for final (100)
    If conditions - ask again
Ask for MEC(30)
    If conditions - ask again
Sum up all grade points
Divide total by 1000
Multiply by 100
    If final grade is 94 or greater, final = A
    If final grade is 90 - 93, final = A-
    If “ “ “ 87 - 89, final = B+
    If “ “ “ 83 - 86, final = B
    If “ “ “ 80 - 82, final = B-
    If “ “ “ 77 - 79, final = C+
    If “ “ “ 73 - 76, final = C
    If “ “ “ 70 - 72, final = C-
    If “ “ “ 67 - 69, final = D+
    If “ “ “ 60 - 66, final = D
    If “ “ “ below 60, final = F
Output final letter grade
